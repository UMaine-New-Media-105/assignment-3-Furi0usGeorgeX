Assignment 3 covers the creation of a game, using a "catcher" that travels along the bottom of the canvas.
For question 1, I decided to make my "catcher" a pirate ship. I created the sprite using the function "drawShip", and created it utilizing beginShape for the base and sails, later adding ellipses for cannons and text to denote the vessel's name: the HMS Procrastinator. I set the ship's X coordinate to mouseX, so that it follows the mouse along the X axis, while staying locked to Y 540. For extra flavor, I added a large blue rectangle for the ship to sit on to simulate the sea, with a bright yellow sun and pinkish-orange sky to display a sunset.
My next goal is assignment 2, in which I will make the ship change shape when the canvas is clicked. I will be making the sails drop open when clicked, and closed when the mouse is not clicked. Additionally, I would like to have moving waves and clouds, sunrays, and make the ship slowly accelerate towards the mouse.
